# HOST-CP
This is the code repository for the paper "Finding High-Value Training Data Subset through Differentiable Convex Programming" accepted at ECML-PKDD 2021. We propose the method HOST-CP (High-value Online Subset selection of Training samples through differentiable Convex Programming) for selecting subsets in an online method.
